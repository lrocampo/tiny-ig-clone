# Tiny Instagram Clone
This is a web app that I made following a tutorial to learn a bit of PHP and Laravel, which tries to replicate some of the funcionality from Instagram with a basic approach.
## But why?
I wanted to get my feet wet on Laravel 8 and the MVC. 
This project was built following [a tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ImtZ5yENzgE?list=PLr6bSl72ifqts4DVYavaUfKeCaQUmVwZ9) presented by freeCodeCamp with the only purpose of giving a chance to this framework.

What I enjoyed the most building this project was the artisan CLI. So powerful.
